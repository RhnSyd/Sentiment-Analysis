## Sentiment Analysis with LSTM and Self-Attention
This repository implements a sentiment analysis model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks combined with a Self-Attention mechanism. It is designed to classify text into sentiment categories, such as positive, negative, or neutral, leveraging the power of recurrent neural networks and attention mechanisms for better context understanding.

# Features
LSTM Network: Captures sequential dependencies in text data.
Self-Attention Mechanism: Enhances the model's ability to focus on the most important words or phrases in the input text.
Customizable Sentiment Classes: Works with datasets containing various sentiment categories.
Scalable Implementation: Suitable for small to large-scale datasets.

# Usage

Training the Model

Prepare your dataset in a CSV or text format with columns for the text and its associated sentiment label.
Modify the data preprocessing section in the Sentiment_Analysis_using_LSTM_and_Self_Attention_Rehan_Syed.ipynb file to load and preprocess your dataset.
Run the Jupyter Notebook to train the model on your data.

Testing the Model

Use the provided test data or your own dataset to evaluate the model's performance.
Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated within the notebook.
